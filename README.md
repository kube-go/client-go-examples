# client-go-examples

## Motivation

The motivation for this repo is that I found it very hard to write kube controllers for the operators since I am not much familiar with [client-go](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go). I am from a SRE background and transitioned into Software Engineering. I found it very hard to understand kubernetes programming, so I am trying ways to simplify this by trying to get a structured approach. Getting familiar with client-go is first step towards it. Organized programs based on usage in this repo.

## Pre-requisites

Most of the examples will need a running kubernetes cluster
